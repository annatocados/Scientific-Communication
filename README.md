# Scientific-Communication-Project

Hello! My name is Anna Tocados (anna.tocados01@estudiant.upf.edu) and I am a student in Universitat Pompeu Fabra. 

The project I upload here is a code developed in my first year of university, in a class called "Tècniques Computacionals en Enginyeria Biomèdica". 
The project itself is a development of a classic table game called 4 in a row but through programming language. 

The main objective of the assignment was getting familiar with algorithm development and encapsulation into functions.
